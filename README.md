# Ideal Linux distro

(Those are only ideas, not going to do it!)

## Package manager

The design should be decentralized.

There should be a distributed package manager that allows a user to build binaries and upload them via a system that also keeps track of stuff. It should work closely with version control systems.

Want a binary? Grab it from some repo / user you trust. (or build from the source code and upload your binary to your server and share it)

You would not be stuck with libwhatever-1.0.2 when version 3.14.15 is already available.

## Encryption

The disks should be encrypted by default like any decent product created after the Snowden revelations.

## Desktop

Gnome shell should be used by default. (It is nice)

## ~~OpenTTD~~

~~OpenTTD should be installed by default.~~
